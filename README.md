Just walked out, my head's spinning—Gap, man, it's like they grabbed my brain and played hopscotch with it. The theater was a zoo, some kid's popcorn ended up scattered like confetti on my lap. But the  ... oh boy. It's this beautiful mess, like photographing chaos, unpredictable light, everything blurring out when you want it sharp.

The smell of buttered popcorn still hangs in the air like a misplaced memory. Like, you ever try to hold onto smoke in your hand, and it just slips through, leaving only the scent? That's the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. It dives right into moments where time doesn't tick normally. Fast-slow-fast-slow, I'm dying to go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again. 

> At one point, I swear the protagonist’s monologue melted and mixed with a random dude's cough in row six. Can't separate the   sounds from the real world noises anymore, like my camera getting confused between ISO and aperture.

Scenes in there—like when she lost her shoes on the subway and just kept walking barefoot—echo in my mind. Reminds me of shooting in the rain without an umbrella; everything soaked and raw and weirdly pure. Or that bizarre sequence—ugh, it's like trying to photograph fog. You think you capture it, but instead, it captures you, you get what I mean?

Maybe don’t 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just yet unless you want your thoughts tangled up like earphones at the bottom of a bag. My back aches from those seats—next time I need a strategic plan for leaning back properly.

There was this scene, UGH, where the city lights flickered like a misfiring flash. Can't tell if it was a glitch in my mind or theirs. It's so tangled. My mind is jumbly—like, when you’ve loaded 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 wrong in the camera and have to unwinding and winding again to get it right, and all you get is a blank strip at the end of it. 

Anyway, lost track now. Did someone ask me about how to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Definitely—I mean—definitely worth seeing it unravel on screen first.

A random thought but: if you ever tried stuffing a zebra into a tuxedo, you get the same feeling of looking at a landscape through a macro lens, almost frustratingly close but never quite fully in focus. 

There’s that pesky memory of the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮’s finale flickering, but whatever, it’s pizza time now. And I can't figure out who I am when I'm not holding my camera—something the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 made me think about. 

def mind_blur(𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, thoughts):
    return Maybe—or—is life just a  ?

I forget—I don’t know what I was coding.
